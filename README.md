# My Forest
### by Joshua Forman


#### This is a personal habit tracker I created. It seems like a cute idea to think of your life events as a forest.

## To Run After Cloning
- $npm install
- $npm start

#### or go to https://myforest-4ec7f.web.app/ to see it live

## Issues
- needs login w/ auth
- give editing & deleting capabilities to events
- add key section
- connect color of sky and background color to 
- needs a mobile build...maybe just a way to add an event
- needs some minor db stuff to hold everyone's everything, nbd

## Bugs
- needs some styling for event details around sides of the screen, unable to read/see
